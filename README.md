## Compatibility with v0 branch

The code in the current main branch has been refactored in Huggingface style, and several issues with the model have been fixed. We have re-trained the models and released new checkpoints in Huggingface Hub. As a result, the old code and new checkpoints are incompatible. We have moved that code into the v0 branch.

## OwlEval
The evaluation dataset OwlEval can be found in ```./OwlEval```.

## Usage
### Install Requirements
1. Create conda environment
```bash
conda create -n mplug_owl python=3.10
conda activate mplug_owl
```

2. Install PyTorch

```
conda install pytorch==1.13.1 torchvision==0.14.1 torchaudio==0.13.1 pytorch-cuda=11.7 -c pytorch -c nvidia
```

3. Install other dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Local Demo
We provide a script to deploy a simple demo in your local machine.
```Bash
python -m serve.web_server --base-model 'your checkpoint directory' --bf16
```
For example, if you want to load the checkpoint `MAGAer13/mplug-owl-llama-7b` from Huggingface Model Hub, here is it.
```Bash
python -m serve.web_server --base-model MAGAer13/mplug-owl-llama-7b --bf16
```

### Run Model with Huggingface Style
#### Model initialization
If you want to load the model (e.g. `MAGAer13/mplug-owl-llama-7b`) from the model hub on Huggingface or on local, you can use the following code snippet.
```Python
# Load via Huggingface Style
from transformers import AutoTokenizer
from mplug_owl.modeling_mplug_owl import MplugOwlForConditionalGeneration
from mplug_owl.processing_mplug_owl import MplugOwlImageProcessor, MplugOwlProcessor

pretrained_ckpt = 'MAGAer13/mplug-owl-llama-7b'
model = MplugOwlForConditionalGeneration.from_pretrained(
    pretrained_ckpt,
    torch_dtype=torch.bfloat16,
)
image_processor = MplugOwlImageProcessor.from_pretrained(pretrained_ckpt)
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(pretrained_ckpt)
processor = MplugOwlProcessor(image_processor, tokenizer)
```

#### Model inference
Prepare model inputs.
```Python
# We use a human/AI template to organize the context as a multi-turn conversation.
# <image> denotes an image placehold.
prompts = [
'''The following is a conversation between a curious human and AI assistant. The assistant gives helpful, detailed, and polite answers to the user's questions.
Human: <image>
Human: Explain why this meme is funny.
AI: ''']

# The image paths should be placed in the image_list and kept in the same order as in the prompts.
# We support urls, local file paths and base64 string. You can custom the pre-process of images by modifying the mplug_owl.modeling_mplug_owl.ImageProcessor
image_list = ['https://xxx.com/image.jpg']
```

Get response.
```Python
# generate kwargs (the same in transformers) can be passed in the do_generate()
generate_kwargs = {
    'do_sample': True,
    'top_k': 5,
    'max_length': 512
}
from PIL import Image
images = [Image.open(_) for _ in image_list]
inputs = processor(text=prompts, images=images, return_tensors='pt')
inputs = {k: v.bfloat16() if v.dtype == torch.float else v for k, v in inputs.items()}
inputs = {k: v.to(model.device) for k, v in inputs.items()}
with torch.no_grad():
    res = model.generate(**inputs, **generate_kwargs)
sentence = tokenizer.decode(res.tolist()[0], skip_special_tokens=True)
print(sentence)
```


### Run Model with provided interface
#### Model initialization
Build model, toknizer and processor.
```Python
from pipeline.interface import get_model
model, tokenizer, processor = get_model(pretrained_ckpt='your checkpoint directory', use_bf16='use bf16 or not')
```

#### Model inference
Prepare model inputs.
```Python
# We use a human/AI template to organize the context as a multi-turn conversation.
# <image> denotes an image placehold.
prompts = [
'''The following is a conversation between a curious human and AI assistant. The assistant gives helpful, detailed, and polite answers to the user's questions.
Human: <image>
Human: Explain why this meme is funny.
AI: ''']

# The image paths should be placed in the image_list and kept in the same order as in the prompts.
# We support urls, local file paths and base64 string. You can custom the pre-process of images by modifying the mplug_owl.modeling_mplug_owl.ImageProcessor
image_list = ['https://xxx.com/image.jpg',]
```

For multiple images inputs, as it is an emergent ability of the models, we do not know which format is the best. Below is an example format we have tried in our experiments. Exploring formats that can help models better understand multiple images could be beneficial and worth further investigation.
```Python
prompts = [
'''The following is a conversation between a curious human and AI assistant. The assistant gives helpful, detailed, and polite answers to the user's questions.
Human: <image>
Human: <image>
Human: Do the shirts worn by the individuals in the first and second pictures vary in color? If so, what is the specific color of each shirt?
AI: ''']

image_list = ['https://xxx.com/image_1.jpg', 'https://xxx.com/image_2.jpg']
```

Get response.
```Python
# generate kwargs (the same in transformers) can be passed in the do_generate()
from pipeline.interface import do_generate
sentence = do_generate(prompts, image_list, model, tokenizer, processor, 
                       use_bf16=True, max_length=512, top_k=5, do_sample=True)
```

### Video Inference
To perform video inference you can use the following code:
```Python
from mplug_owl_video.modeling_mplug_owl import MplugOwlForConditionalGeneration
from transformers import AutoTokenizer
from mplug_owl_video.processing_mplug_owl import MplugOwlImageProcessor, MplugOwlProcessor

pretrained_ckpt = 'MAGAer13/mplug-owl-llama-7b-video'
model = MplugOwlForConditionalGeneration.from_pretrained(
    pretrained_ckpt,
    torch_dtype=torch.bfloat16,
)
image_processor = MplugOwlImageProcessor.from_pretrained(pretrained_ckpt)
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(pretrained_ckpt)
processor = MplugOwlProcessor(image_processor, tokenizer)

# We use a human/AI template to organize the context as a multi-turn conversation.
# <|video|> denotes an video placehold.
prompts = [
'''The following is a conversation between a curious human and AI assistant. The assistant gives helpful, detailed, and polite answers to the user's questions.
Human: <|video|>
Human: What is the woman doing in the video?
AI: ''']

video_list = ['yoga.mp4']

# generate kwargs (the same in transformers) can be passed in the do_generate()
generate_kwargs = {
    'do_sample': True,
    'top_k': 5,
    'max_length': 512
}
inputs = processor(text=prompts, videos=video_list, num_frames=4, return_tensors='pt')
inputs = {k: v.bfloat16() if v.dtype == torch.float else v for k, v in inputs.items()}
inputs = {k: v.to(model.device) for k, v in inputs.items()}
with torch.no_grad():
    res = model.generate(**inputs, **generate_kwargs)
sentence = tokenizer.decode(res.tolist()[0], skip_special_tokens=True)
print(sentence)
```

### Instruction Tuning
The training samples are stored in ```xxx.jsonl``` and orgnized in the following format:
```json
{"text": "The following is a conversation between a curious human and AI assistant. The assistant gives helpful, detailed, and polite answers to the user's questions.\nHuman: Construct a sentence using the given verb in the past tense\nshudder\nAI: She shuddered at the thought of being alone in the dark.", "task_type": "gpt4instruct_sft"}
{"image": ["xxx.jpg"], "text": "The following is a conversation between a curious human and AI assistant. The assistant gives helpful, detailed, and polite answers to the user's questions.\nHuman: <image>\nHuman: Where is the man located in the image?\nAI: The man is located in a small restaurant, sitting and enjoying his meal.\nHuman: What type of food is the man eating in the image?\nAI: The man is eating a burrito in the image.\nHuman: What can be seen next to the man in the restaurant?\nAI: Next to the man in the restaurant, there is a fridge filled with cans of soda.\nHuman: How does the man feel as he is about to eat his meal?\nAI: The man looks happy and is smiling as he is about to take a bite of his meal.\nHuman: What unique aspect of the photo makes the scene appear distorted or unusual?\nAI: The unique aspect of this photo is that it was taken using a fish-eye lens, which creates a distorted, wide-angle view of the scene, making it appear different from a standard perspective.", "task_type": "llava_sft"}
```
The ```task_type``` can be in one of ```{'quora_chat_sft', 'sharegpt_chat_sft', 'llava_sft', 'gpt4instruct_sft'}```.

Prepare your own train.jsonl and dev.jsonl and modify ```data_files``` in ```configs/v0.yaml```.

Execute the training script.
```
PYTHONPATH=./ bash train_it.sh # If you want to finetune LLM, replace it with train_it_wo_lora.sh
```

### Usage with Replicate

You can also now run the model and demo locally with [`cog`](https://github.com/replicate/cog), an open source ML tool maintained by Replicate. To get started, follow the instructions in this `cog` [fork](https://github.com/replicate/cog-mplug-owl) of `mPLUG-Owl`.

## Deal with NaN issue
We notice that some users are suffering from loss of NaN issue.

There is a high possibility that the issue is caused by the prompt being too long and the part complement being cut off during preprocessing. As a result, the ```label_mask``` is all -100 and ```CrossEntropy``` will return a loss of NaN. There are three potential solutions to this issue:

1. Prevent feeding input_ids that do not include any complement.
2. Set the ```reduction='none'``` in the CrossEntropyLoss of Llama and reduce the loss with an epsilon value like ```outputs.loss = (outputs.loss * loss_mask.view(-1)).sum()/(loss_mask.sum()+1e-5)```.
3. Simply set ```output.loss=output.loss*0``` if you get a loss of NaN.

## Performance Comparison
The comparison results of 50 single-turn responses (left) and 52 multi-turn responses (right) between mPLUG-Owl and baselines with manual evaluation metrics. A/B/C/D denote the rate of each response.
